						<h2>What is the Mindfulness?</h2>
						<p>Mindfulness is the psychological process of bringing one's
						   attention to experiences occurring in the present moment, 
						   which one can develop through the practice of meditation 
						   and through other training.</p>

						<h2>Optimism</h2>
						<p>Optimism is a mental attitude reflecting a belief or hope that the outcome of some specific endeavor, 
						or outcomes in general, will be positive, favorable, and desirable. A common idiom used to illustrate 
						optimism versus pessimism is a glass filled with water to the halfway point: an optimist is said to see 
						the glass as half full, while a pessimist sees the glass as half empty.</p>
